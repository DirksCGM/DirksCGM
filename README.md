### Hi there I am Dirk Steynberg ðŸ‘‹
(AKA DirkSCGM)

**Data Specialist and Entrepreneurship & Innovation NQF 8 BSc with Prof Cert. in Data Analytics and Engineering**

<br/>

## ðŸ’¬ Bio

I grew up in the deep rural Drakensberg Mountains of South Africa. When I was a child I found an old PC discarded and struck by lightning and decided to repair it myself, I always wanted my own computer and it was a fine opportunity. That was the first time I got into technology and programming. I remember writing Basic and Python code growing up, always pottering with the endless fascination of computers, computing and gaming. In my school years, I would find every opportunity to tinker with machines and computers.

This fascination led me into an insatiable desire to do and experience everything there was to understand about technology. I decided to start my own freelance company and take on odd jobs from clients all over the world who needed projects done. Projects that ranged from front-end, back-end, software development, and even computer-generated multimedia. I soon took on more prominent projects that granted me the financial freedom to learn more and do more and explore the world and slowly found my niche in the great world of the information age.

I am now an avid Data Specialist with 4 to 5 years of professional experience as a Data Engineer, Data Analyst and Python Developer. Working my way to a degree in Entrepreneurship & Innovation and several ProfCerts and a GradCert under my name. My appetite for knowledge has led me to the greater world of technology and science. There is certainly more to learn, but my ambitions grow ever bigger as I endlessly endeavour to understand and do more.
